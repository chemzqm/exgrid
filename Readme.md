Exgrid is built on simple [components](https://component.github.io), yet including all the features for daily usage, ie:

* paging
* sorting
* filter
* local/remote mode
* custom formatter/render
* data change reactive
* event delegation

The api is straightforward and magic is limited to make it quite easy to work with.

## Usage

Define a template like this:
``` html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th data-sort="string">name</th>
      <th data-sort="number">age</th>
      <th data-sort="number">score</th>
      <th data-sort="number">percentage</th>
      <th data-sort="number">money</th>
      <th>active</th>
      <th>action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">{name}</td>
      <td>{age}</td>
      <td data-format="integer">{score}</td>
      <td data-render="percentage"></td>
      <td class="money" data-format="chineseMoney">{money}</td>
      <td data-render="setActive" class="center"></td>
      <td data-react="stat" data-render="renderAction"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
_The last `tr` element in `tbody` is used as the template for repeat rendering the rows._

Init the grid, render it to html and set data:
``` js
var grid = new Grid(template, {
  perpage: 10,
  formatters: {
    chineseMoney: function (money) {
      return 'Â¥' + money.toFixed(2)
    }
  },
  renders: {
    percentage: function (model, el) {
      el.textContent = (model.percent * 100).toFixed() + '%'
    },
    setActive: function (model, el) {
      var cb = document.createElement('input')
      cb.type = 'checkbox'
      cb.checked = model.isActive
      el.innerHTML = ''
      cb.addEventListener('change', function () {
        // save value to model
        model.isActive = cb.checked
      }, false)
      el.appendChild(cb)
    },
    renderAction: function (model, el) {
      el.innerHTML = '<button class="save" ' + (model.changed() ? '' : 'disabled') + '>save</button>'
    }
  }
})

document.body.appendChild(grid.el)
//data is array of plain javascript object
grid.setData(data)
```


##API

### Grid(string | element, [options])

options including :

  * perpage (Number) the max count of rows for rendering
  * [paging] (Boolean: false) using paging
  * [remote] (Boolean: false) set this to true to make the grid works on remote mode
  * [formatters] (Object) user defined formatter functions
  * [renders] (Object) user defined render functions, called with `model` and the binded node

### .setData(Array)

Set the data with Object array, should always be called after remote request.

### .prepend(Object)

Render the object to the first row.

### .setPage(n)

Set page number to n (0 based).

### setTotal(n)

Set total count for pager to work properly.

### prepend(obj, [element])

Create row with obj and prepend to el (default: frist child of tbody)

### .sort(field, direction, method)

Sort grid with field name and direction (-1 or 1) or with the given sort method (value cound be `string` `number` or a sort function)

### .filter(field, val)

Filter data with field and val (optional filter function), then redirect to first page and show data
no data would be filtered when the val is null or empty string

### .refresh()

Trigger the refresh event for data receiving.

### .remove()

Unbind all events and remove the created elements

## Events

* `construct` emitted on grid created with `params` as parameter
* `sort` emitted on sorting with `params` as parameter (only emit on remote mode)
* `page` emitted on paging with `params` as parameter (only emit on remote mode)
* `empty` emitted when no data could be shown
* `refresh` emitted when `refresh` is called
* `click` emitted with `event` and `row` on body click
* `destroy` emitted when grid is removed
