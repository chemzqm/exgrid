Exgrid has rebuild with [reactive-lite](https://github.com/chemzqm/reactive-lite), beside flexable binding methods and binding resue for excellence performance, it can do:

* paging
* sorting
* filter
* local/remote mode
* custom formatter/render
* data change reactive
* event delegation

## Install

with npm

    npm install exgrid --save

## Usage

Define a template like this:
``` html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="sort" data-sort="name">name</th>
      <th class="sort" data-sort="age">age</th>
      <th>company</th>
      <th class="sort" data-sort="number">money</th>
      <th>active</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">{name}</td>
      <td style="width:30px;">{age}</td>
      <td class="left">{company}</td>
      <td class="money">Â¥{money | currency 2}</td>
      <td data-render="setActive" class="center"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
```
_The last `tr` element in `tbody` is used as the template for repeat rendering._

Init the grid, render it to html and set data:
``` js
var grid = new Grid(template, {
  perpage: 10,
  // filters for reactive-lite
  filters: {
    percentage: function (val) {
      return (val*100).toFixed() + '%'
    }
  },
  // bindings for reactive-lite
  bindings: {
    react: function (prop) {
      this.bind('$stat', function (model, el) {
        ...
      })
    }
  },
  // delegate object for reactive-lite
  delegate: {
    setActive: function (model, el) {
      ...
    }
  }
})
// use local mode
grid.local()
// render element
placeholder.appendChild(pager.el)
grid.setData(data)
```
## Events

* `sort` emit with params when remote sort needed (including `sortField` `sortDirection`)
* `filter` emit with params when remote filter needed (including `filterField` `filterValud`)
* `page` emit with params when remote paging needed (including `curpage`, `perpage`)
* `change` emit after table row add or removed
* `remove` emit just before this component removed

##API

### Grid(el, [option])

* `el` table element or template string as root node
* `option` optional option for [list-render](https://github.com/chemzqm/list-render)
* `option.perpage` max page count perpage, works with [pager](https://github.com/chemzqm/pager) (need Object.definePropety support)
* `option.delegate` delegate object for [reactive](https://github.com/chemzqm/reactive-lite)
* `option.bindings` bindings object for [reactive](https://github.com/chemzqm/reactive-lite)
* `option.filters` filters object for [reactive](https://github.com/chemzqm/reactive-lite)
* `option.model` [model](https://github.com/chemzqm/model) class used for generate model
* `option.empty` String or Element rendered in parentNode when internal data list is empty
* `option.limit` the limit number for render when `setData()` (equal to perpage if not set)

Exgrid inherits all methods from [list-render](https://github.com/chemzqm/list-render), the extra methods are shown below

### .bind(type, selector, handler)

Delegate event `type` to `selector` with `handler`,
handler is called with event and a reactive model

### .local()

Make list works on local model, which means sort, filter and paging  only happens locally

### .sort(field, dir, [method])

Sort the data by field, direction or method, when it's remote mode(default mode), emit event only

### .filter(field, val|function)

Filter the data by field, val or function, when it's remote mode(default mode), emit event only

### .select(n)

Select page `n`, when it's remote mode(default mode), emit event only

### .setTotal(n)

Set total data count for paging, can not used for local mode

### .remove()

Unbind all events and remove the created elements
